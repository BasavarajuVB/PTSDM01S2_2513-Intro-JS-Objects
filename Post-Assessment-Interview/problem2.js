// Problem-2

// Student Exam Analysis
// Background:
// A school maintains students' scores from recent exams. Each student has scores in Math, Science, and English, ranging from 0 to 100.

// You will analyze this data using JavaScript objects.

// Tasks:
// Determine Pass or Fail:

// A student passes if they score 40 or above in all three subjects.

// Otherwise, they fail.

// Count Passing and Failing Students:

// Calculate how many students passed and how many failed.
// Calculate Scholarship Amount:

// Each passing student gets a scholarship of â‚¹5000.

// Calculate the total scholarship amount.
